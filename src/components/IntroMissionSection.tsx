            Planning in the UK is complex, discretionary, and often overwhelmed by paperwork, policy layers, and reactive processes. The Plannerâ€™s Assistant is an open-source tool designed to help planning authorities, housing advocates, and civic technologists cut through the noiseâ€”without cutting corners.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-8">
            We combine AI reasoning, GIS constraint analysis, and structured policy interpretation to support the decision-making process, not replace it. The goal isnâ€™t to automate planningâ€”itâ€™s to build tools that help humans see clearly, reason transparently, and act justly in the built environment.

            To build an open, modular, and explainable AI planning platform that:

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 text-lg mb-6">
            <li>Supports planning officers and civic actors, not replaces them</li>
            <li>Interprets policies spatially and contextually, not just semantically</li>
            <li>Audits local plans, highlights contradictions, and proposes alternatives</li>
            <li>Enables faster, fairer, and more transparent planning decisions</li>
            <li>Works alongside existing systems (e.g. BOPS, PlanX) rather than competing with them</li>
            <li>Remains open-source and publicly accountableâ€”accessible to LPAs, researchers, and citizens alike</li>
        </ul>
         <p className="text-lg italic">
            We're designing for a world where AI is a trusted co-pilot in the planning process: transparent, auditable, and grounded in real-world constraintsâ€”not a black box.
